# Undo Performance Optimization Test Coverage Analysis

## 1. UndoManager Changes

### Changed Code:
- **Added fields**: 
  - `_undo_diff_sub` in UndoManager (subscription to collect undo diffs)
  - `pending_undo_diff` in UndoManagerInner (temporarily stores diffs during transactions)
  - `undo_diff` in StackItem (stores pre-calculated undo diffs)

### Test Coverage:
- **undo_consistency.rs**: Tests the new UndoManager behavior with various scenarios:
  - `test_undo_consistency_basic_operations`: Tests undo/redo with text operations
  - `test_undo_consistency_with_containers`: Tests with multiple container types
  - `test_undo_consistency_with_concurrent_changes`: Tests with remote changes
  - `test_undo_consistency_with_grouped_operations`: Tests grouped undo operations
  - `test_undo_uses_precalculated_diffs`: Specifically verifies the optimization is used

## 2. Container State Changes

### CounterState (apply_local_op)
**Changed Code**: Generates negative diff for undo (e.g., +5 generates -5 for undo)

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_counter_undo_diff_generation` in undo.rs: Tests increment operations generate negative diffs
- `test_undo_consistency_counter_operations` in undo_consistency.rs: Tests full undo/redo cycle

### MapState (apply_local_op)
**Changed Code**: Handles insert (undo removes key), update (undo restores old value), delete (undo restores value)

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_map_undo_diff_generation` in undo.rs: Tests all three cases (insert, update, delete)
- `test_undo_consistency_with_containers` in undo_consistency.rs: Tests map operations in mixed container scenario

### ListState (apply_local_op)
**Changed Code**: Insert generates delete diff, delete generates insert diff with original values

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_list_undo_diff_generation` in undo.rs: Tests insert and delete operations
- `test_undo_diff_batch_operations` in undo.rs: Tests list in batch operations
- `test_undo_consistency_with_containers` in undo_consistency.rs: Tests list undo/redo

### TreeState (apply_local_op)
**Changed Code**: Create generates delete diff, delete generates create diff, move generates reverse move

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_tree_undo_diff_generation` in undo.rs: Tests create and delete operations
- `test_tree_undo_integration` in undo.rs: Tests move operations
- `test_undo_consistency_with_tree_operations` in undo_consistency.rs: Full tree undo/redo cycle

### RichTextState (apply_local_op)
**Changed Code**: Insert text generates delete, delete generates insert, style changes generate reverse styles

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_richtext_undo_diff_generation` in undo.rs: Tests text insert/delete
- `test_undo_consistency_with_richtext_styles` in undo_consistency.rs: Tests style operations
- `test_richtext_undo.rs`: Additional richtext-specific undo tests

### MovableListState (apply_local_op)
**Changed Code**: Insert/delete/move/set operations generate appropriate undo diffs

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_movable_list_undo_diff_generation` in undo.rs: Tests insert, set, move, and delete
- `test_undo_consistency_movable_list` in undo_consistency.rs: Full undo/redo cycle

## 3. Infrastructure Changes

### subscribe_undo_diffs method
**Changed Code**: New subscription mechanism to collect undo diffs during operations

**Test Coverage**:
- All `test_*_undo_diff_generation` tests use this subscription
- `test_undo_diff_concurrent_edits` in undo.rs: Tests subscription with concurrent edits

### DiffBatch composition and transformation
**Changed Code**: Methods to compose and transform diff batches

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_undo_diff_batch_operations` in undo.rs: Tests batch operations
- `test_apply_undo_diff_restores_state` in undo.rs: Tests diff application concept

## 4. Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_undo_diff_empty_operations` in undo.rs: Tests failed operations don't generate diffs
- `test_undo_diff_nested_containers` in undo.rs: Tests nested container structures
- `test_undo_consistency_empty_operations` in undo_consistency.rs: Tests insert+delete scenarios
- `test_undo_consistency_stress` in undo_consistency.rs: Tests with 100 operations

## Summary

**Well-Covered Areas**:
- All container types have dedicated undo diff generation tests
- All container types have undo/redo consistency tests
- Edge cases like empty operations, nested containers, and concurrent edits are tested
- Batch operations and grouped undo operations are tested
- The infrastructure (subscription mechanism) is tested

**Potential Gaps**:
- No explicit test for the `pending_undo_diff` field behavior during transactions
- Tree move operations could have more comprehensive tests for complex scenarios
- No explicit test for the `_undo_diff_sub` field lifecycle in UndoManager

**Overall Assessment**: The test coverage is comprehensive, with all major code changes having corresponding tests. The tests cover both unit-level diff generation and integration-level undo/redo behavior.

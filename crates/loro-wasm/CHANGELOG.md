## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 35b9b6e: Movable List (#293)

  Loro's List supports insert and delete operations but lacks built-in methods for `set` and `move`. To simulate set and move, developers might combine delete and insert. However, this approach can lead to issues during concurrent operations on the same element, often resulting in duplicate entries upon merging.

  For instance, consider a list [0, 1, 2]. If user A moves the element '0' to position 1, while user B moves it to position 2, the ideal merged outcome should be either [1, 0, 2] or [1, 2, 0]. However, using the delete-insert method to simulate a move results in [1, 0, 2, 0], as both users delete '0' from its original position and insert it independently at new positions.

  To address this, we introduce a MovableList container. This new container type directly supports move and set operations, aligning more closely with user expectations and preventing the issues associated with simulated moves.

  ## Example

  ```ts
  import { Loro } from "loro-crdt";
  import { expect } from "vitest";

  const doc = new Loro();
  const list = doc.getMovableList("list");
  list.push("a");
  list.push("b");
  list.push("c");
  expect(list.toArray()).toEqual(["a", "b", "c"]);
  list.set(2, "d");
  list.move(0, 1);
  const doc2 = new Loro();
  const list2 = doc2.getMovableList("list");
  expect(list2.length).toBe(0);
  doc2.import(doc.exportFrom());
  expect(list2.length).toBe(3);
  expect(list2.get(0)).toBe("b");
  expect(list2.get(1)).toBe("a");
  expect(list2.get(2)).toBe("d");
  ```

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- BREAKING CHANGE: `detached` mode for Containers #300

  Now creating sub-containers is much easier.

  A container can be either attached to a document or detached. When it's detached, its history/state is not persisted. You can attach a container to a document by inserting it into an existing attached container. Once a container is attached, its state, along with all of its descendants's states, will be recreated in the document. After attaching, the container and its descendants will each have their corresponding "attached" version of themselves.

  When a detached container x is attached to a document, you can use `x.getAttached()` to obtain the corresponding attached container.

  When we use const text = new LoroList(), it's not attached to a doc. But we can insert it into a doc by map.insertContainer(”t”, text), where the map is attached. But if we want the operations on the text to be recorded to the doc, we now need to get its attached version. So we can use “let attachedText = text.getAttached()”
